// variables file. but you knew that.

// alright. let's get ambitious here. 
// instead of using actual --variables, which ie cannot see at all, 
// I'm going to assign base variable colors, and where needed, change the value
// based on body class. That way, ie can see it, and we can still do what we need to. 

// i dunno if i'm keeping this at all now. 

$black: #000000;
$white: #ffffff;


// for default colorscheme: 





// a pretty blue, change the body bg color and site follows suit. #87adc8
// and a pink that looks nice #fa6fa2, 930337
